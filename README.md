# 🎤 Speech-to-Image Generator 🖼️  

A Python-based AI project that takes **speech input** and generates an image based on the spoken description.  

## 🚀 Features  
- Converts speech to text using `speech_recognition`  
- Generates images based on recognized text  
- Uses **Stability AI's API** for image generation  

## 🛠️ Installation  
1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
2. Run the project with `python main.py`.  

## 📦 Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- `speech_recognition`  
- `stability_sdk`  
- `openai` (if used for text processing)  

## 📝 Usage  
1. Run `python main.py`.  
2. Speak into your microphone when prompted.  
3. The application will process your speech and generate an image based on the recognized text.  

## 📸 Output  
- The generated images will be saved in the `output` folder.  

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting  
- If `speech_recognition` fails, check your microphone permissions.  
- If `stability_sdk` is missing, install it with `pip install stability-sdk`.
